## Welcome to Chee Wai's Home for Public Technical Projects

### Personal Projects

No functioning projects as of yet. The following is a stub:

- [Testbed Code](https://cheelee.github.io/testbeds)

:warning: Trying to figure out if there is a way to automatically
populate a list of my projects by checking that they are Github Pages
enabled for them. That would be far superior to manually populating them here.

#### All My Public Repositories

{% for repository in site.github.public_repositories %}
  * [{{ repository.name }}]({{ repository.html_url }})
{% endfor %}

### OpenWorm

Check out my volunteer work with the [OpenWorm](https://github.com/openworm) project:
